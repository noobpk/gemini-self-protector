## Support

| Language | Platform/ Framework |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Python   | Flask               |

## Deep Learning

Gemini uses a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a family of Recurrent neural network (RNN) techniques to detect and identify vulnerabilities.
