Gemini - The Runtime Application Self Protection (RASP) Solution Combined With Deep Learning

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/noobpk/gemini-self-protector/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/noobpk/gemini-self-protector/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

## Architecture

The architecture of gemini-self-protector is composed of seven layers however it is optimized so as not to affect the performance on the application.

## Support

| Language | Platform/ Framework |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Python   | Flask               |

## Deep Learning

Gemini uses a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to detect and identify vulnerabilities. This model uses convolution operation to determine the feature attributes and internal relationships in the input data thereby improving the accuracy of vulnerability detection.
