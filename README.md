Gemini - The Runtime Application Self Protection Solution Combined With Deep Learning

# Support

| Language | Platform/ Framework |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Python   | Flask               |

# Deep Learning

Gemini utilizes the deep learning model called Character-level Convolutional Neural Network (Char-CNN) to detect and identify vulnerabilities. Char-CNN is capable of analyzing features at each character in the input data, using convolution operation to identify distinctive features in the data, thus improving the accuracy of vulnerability detection.
